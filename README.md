For growing plant and mushroom allow control of temperature and moisture in the enviroment. 
this project was designed using Kikad

It about automatisation control of humidity and temperature for plants and fungi growing
I make hardware design but not realised as a physical object.  
The project needed to finish software parts 

In my main idea, it could be used as mesh system for big rooms, and as individual sensors for smaller

I hope it will be usefull for somebody
